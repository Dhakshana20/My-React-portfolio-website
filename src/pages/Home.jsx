          I'm an aspiring React Front-End Developer passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly websites. I recently completed my B.E. in Computer Science at Alagappa Chettiar Government College of Engineering and Technology, Karaikudi. I'm actively building real-world projects using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. Additionally, I'm exploring Java and machine learning to broaden my technical foundation.
